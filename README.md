You should to upload this file and add it with main.ipynb in one

2. Each row describes an accident with features such as:
- Geographic location (`Start_Lat`, `Start_Lng`)
- Time (`Start_Time`, `End_Time`, `Hour`, `Month`)
- Weather conditions (`Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Weather_Condition`, etc.)
- Road features (`Amenity`, `Traffic_Signal`, `Crossing`, etc.)
- Target: `Severity` (1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe)
